    "## 1.1 Motivation\n",
    "Fraud detection has become an increasingly critical task in financial systems and digital transactions, where even a small number of fraudulent activities can result in significant financial losses and erode trust in institutions. The complexity of detecting fraud arises from its rarity and the constantly evolving tactics used by fraudsters to conceal illicit activities within massive volumes of legitimate transactions. As organizations handle millions of financial operations daily, distinguishing fraudulent patterns from normal behavior is both technically challenging and essential for operational security and customer trust."

    "## 1.2 Dataset\n",
    "The dataset used in this project, named Fraud.csv, consists of approximately 6 million synthetic financial transactions, created to reflect realistic banking operations while protecting privacy. Each transaction record contains several attributes that describe its details, including both numerical and categorical features. The primary challenge posed by this dataset is the severe class imbalance, as fraudulent transactions account for fewer than 0.2% of all records, making fraud detection a complex and highly imbalanced classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset includes the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- step: The hour of the simulation.\n",
    "- type: The type of transaction, such as PAYMENT, TRANSFER, CASH_OUT, DEBIT, or CASH_IN.\n",
    "- amount: The amount of money involved in the transaction.\n",
    "- nameOrig: An anonymized identifier for the originator’s account.\n",
    "- oldbalanceOrg: The account balance of the originator before the transaction.\n",
    "- newbalanceOrig: The account balance of the originator after the transaction.\n",
    "- nameDest: An anonymized identifier for the recipient’s account.\n",
    "- oldbalanceDest: The account balance of the recipient before the transaction.\n",
    "- newbalanceDest: The account balance of the recipient after the transaction.\n",
    "- isFraud: A binary label indicating whether the transaction was fraudulent (1) or not (0).\n",
    "- isFlaggedFraud: A binary flag indicating whether the transaction was flagged as suspicious by internal business rules."
