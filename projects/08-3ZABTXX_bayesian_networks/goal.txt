Project Tilman and Aaron:

The available Dataset consists of roughly 35 usable Data Points with 28 Features, 
where most of the Features are probably not important. 

The Data measures biological markers in the blood of cancer patients undergoing a special therapy.

Outcome of the Data is on an ordinal scale, but will probably be divided in binary groups of therapy success
and no therapy success.

Our Plan: -> Start with an exploratory Data Analysis to detect correlations and check the predictors' distributions
          -> (maybe) Feature Engineering to detect implicite features that could important for the Model (->e.g. ratio of predictors)
          -> Build a Logistic Regression Model using Lasso Logistic Regression or forward feature selection
          -> Access the quality of the Regression Model and evaluate
