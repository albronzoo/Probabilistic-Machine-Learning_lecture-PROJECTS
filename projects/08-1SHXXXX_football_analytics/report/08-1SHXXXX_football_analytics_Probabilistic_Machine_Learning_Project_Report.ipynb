In total there are data and every event that happend for over 3000 matches from more than 20 competitions. They are puplished on the [statsbomb github](https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data).

        "\n",
        "Second, in my free time I am an ambitious youth team coach. Being able to quantify the quality of scoring chances can offer valuable insights into my team's performance. It allows me to go beyond just goals and results, and instead evaluate whether we are consistently creating good opportunities and where we can improve. With an xG model, I can provide more objective feedback to players, helping them understand the impact of their decisions in the final third and supporting their development with data-driven guidance."

        "In recent years, football analytics has become an increasingly data-driven field, with advanced metrics such as expected goals (xG) now a regular feature in match broadcasts, scouting reports, and tactical analysis. One of the most widely used and freely accessible football datasets is provided by Hudl StatsBomb, offering detailed event data from over 3,000 matches across more than 20 competitions — including full career coverage of Lionel Messi. The dataset contains every recorded on-ball event, from shots and passes to pressures and duels, making it a rich resource for building and evaluating predictive models.\n",
        "\n",
        "This project investigates whether football shot outcomes can be more effectively modeled by explicitly incorporating uncertainty into xG predictions. Using the StatsBomb event data, all recorded shots are processed to construct feature representations that capture spatial, contextual, and tactical aspects of chance creation. These features are then used to train both traditional point-estimate models, such as logistic regression, and probabilistic approaches, including Bayesian logistic regression and Bayesian neural networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "The study aims to address the following questions:\n",
        "\n",
        "* How does explicitly modeling predictive uncertainty influence the accuracy and interpretability of xG estimates?\n",
        "* Can uncertainty quantification reveal differences between players or shot types that point estimates overlook?\n",
        "* How do probabilistic models compare to standard approaches in supporting practical football applications such as scouting, tactical design, and player development?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "To answer these questions, the project systematically compares probabilistic and non-probabilistic methods, evaluating their performance and the additional insights gained from uncertainty measures. The analysis explores how this richer information can distinguish players who consistently create high-quality chances from those with more volatile performance, ultimately enabling better-informed recruitment, lineup, and tactical decisions."
