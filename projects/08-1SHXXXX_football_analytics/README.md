Project Report - Football Analytics
Abstract


This repository contains the results and related materials for the Probabilistic Machine Learning project.

The core of this project, including a comprehensive description of the methodology, detailed results, and analyses, is presented in a Jupyter Notebook.

To access the full project details and results, please navigate to the results folder and open the project_report_lukas_pasold.ipynb notebook.

Within this notebook, all other necessary data and code files used in the project are linked. You can easily access and review these files by clicking on the respective links within the notebook.
Project Structure

    results/: This directory contains the main project report notebook (project_report_lukas_pasold.ipynb) and any generated visualizations or output data.

    notebooks/: This directory contains scripts and notebooks used for data collection, processing and classification.

    data/: This directory contains the processed image data as .csv files. Due to the size constraints, the full image dataset is not directly included but links to the original sources are provided.

Data Sources



Getting Started

Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/IvaroEkel/Probabilistic-Machine-Learning_lecture-PROJECTS.git cd XX   

    Open the Notebook:

    GitHub: You can view the notebook directly on GitHub, though you won't be able to run the code.

    Google Colab: The most convenient way to run the notebook is often through Google Colab. Look for a "Open in Colab" badge or link within the notebook's GitHub preview.

    Jupyter Notebook/JupyterLab (Local): If you prefer to work locally, you'll need to have Jupyter installed. If you don't, you can install it via pip.

Dependencies

The project relies on standard Python libraries for data manipulation, machine learning, and visualization. Please refer to the requirements.txt.

It is recommended to create a virtual environment for the project:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
